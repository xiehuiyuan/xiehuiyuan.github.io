Hi! I am a Master student at Beihang University, China. Currently, I work on Belief Revision under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Li](http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~liwei/). Before this, I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from School of Computer Science & Engineering, Beihang University in July 2014.

My recent research interests are machine translation and natural language generation. My CV is available [here](data/cv/hxie-cv.pdf), and my previous papers can be found on my [research](research.html) page.

[Here](personal.html) is some other information about me.

I can be reached via email at `xiehuiyuan AT buaa.edu.cn`.
